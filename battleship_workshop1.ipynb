    "## Game Loops in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "In game development, the **game loop** is the heart of the game. It repeatedly handles user inputs, updates the game state, and renders the visuals on the screen. The loop continues until the game ends, ensuring an interactive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Process Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The game loop starts by processing user input, which is usually done by listening to events. In the provided code, this happens in the `for event in pygame.event.get()` loop. The input processed here includes:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Mouse Clicks (`MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`):** The user can click on the game grid to make a move. Based on the coordinates of the mouse click, the game decides whether the player is interacting with their own grid or their opponent's grid.\n",
    "   - **Key Presses (`KEYDOWN`):** The game listens for keyboard events such as:\n",
    "     - **Escape Key (`K_ESCAPE`)** to close the game.\n",
    "     - **Space Bar (`K_SPACE`)** to pause or unpause the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The input here triggers updates to the game state, such as changing whose turn it is or processing the player’s move.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Update Game State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Once the input is processed, the game state needs to be updated based on the input and the rules of the game. This is done in the `make_move` method, which updates the search grid of the current player, marks hits and misses, checks if any ships are sunk, and switches the turn between the two players.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Making a Move:** The player’s move is processed (hit or miss), and the game checks if any of the opponent's ships are sunk after a hit.\n",
    "   - **Switching Turns:** After a move is made, the game switches the active player, making the game alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The game state is updated by altering the `search` grid of each player (either marking it with `\"H\"` for hit, `\"M\"` for miss, or `\"S\"` for sunk).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Render:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   After the game state is updated, the next step is to render the game state to the screen, making the game visually interactive. In the provided code, this is done in the following lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Draw Background:** The screen is filled with a grey background (`SCREEN.fill(GREY)`).\n",
    "   - **Draw Grids:** The search grids of both players are drawn in their respective locations. Each player has a search grid and a position grid.\n",
    "   - **Draw Ships:** Ships are drawn on the position grids to represent where the ships are placed for each player.\n",
    "   - **Update the Screen:** After everything is drawn, `pygame.display.flip()` updates the screen to show the latest changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Loop Continuation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   These steps (processing input, updating the game state, and rendering) are executed repeatedly inside the game loop until the game ends. The loop will continue to run as long as the game is not paused or closed, ensuring a continuous and dynamic gameplay experience.\n",

    "## Pygame Animation with User Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Handling\n",
    "The code begins by checking for different types of events during the animation loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Handling Window Closure:**\n",
    "   - The program listens for the `QUIT` event, which happens when the user closes the window. If this event is triggered, the `animating` variable is set to `False`, stopping the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Handling Mouse Clicks:**\n",
    "   - The program also listens for mouse button events. When the mouse is clicked (`MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`), it tracks the mouse's coordinates (`x`, `y`).\n",
    "   - Based on the player's turn, it determines if the mouse click is within the player's grid:\n",
    "     - **Player 1's Grid:** The click is checked to ensure it falls within the bounds of Player 1’s search grid (top left corner).\n",
    "     - **Player 2's Grid:** Similarly, the click is checked for Player 2’s grid (bottom right corner).\n",
    "   - After determining which grid is clicked, the program calculates the row and column of the clicked square, then converts the position into an index using the formula: `index = row * 10 + col`. This index is then passed to `game.make_move()` to update the game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Handling Keyboard Events:**\n",
    "   - The program also listens for key presses, such as:\n",
    "     - **Escape Key (`K_ESCAPE`)**: When pressed, the animation stops by setting `animating = False`.\n",
    "     - **Space Bar (`K_SPACE`)**: Toggles the `pausing` state between `True` and `False`, which pauses or unpauses the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Animation and Drawing\n",
    "If the game is not paused (`pausing = False`), the animation continues:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Drawing the Background:**\n",
    "   - The screen is filled with a grey background color: `SCREEN.fill(GREY)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Drawing the Grids:**\n",
    "   - The grids for both players are drawn in different sections of the screen:\n",
    "     - **Player 1's Search Grid:** The search grid for Player 1 is drawn at the top-left corner.\n",
    "     - **Player 2's Search Grid:** The search grid for Player 2 is drawn at the bottom-right corner.\n",
    "   - **Player 1's Position Grid:** This grid is drawn at the top-right corner.\n",
    "   - **Player 2's Position Grid:** This grid is drawn at the bottom-left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Drawing Ships:**\n",
    "   - The ships for both players are drawn on their respective position grids:\n",
    "     - **Player 1's Ships:** The ships are drawn on Player 1’s position grid (top-right).\n",
    "     - **Player 2's Ships:** The ships are drawn on Player 2’s position grid (bottom-left).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Updating the Screen:**\n",
    "   - After everything is drawn, the screen is updated using `pygame.display.flip()`, which updates the display to reflect the latest changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop runs continuously, handling user inputs and updating the game state. The animation continues until the user closes the window or pauses the game.\n",
